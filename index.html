            <p>JoGames235 was a channel thought up to be a "Gaming channel that was meant for people that just need something to relax to."  If you have ever seen his content you would know that this is somewhat true. JoGames235 makes a variety of content ranging from his “Gameplay to relax to” series, to his music which ended up moving over to his side channel “JoMusic235”.

            <p> After Blu retired, he went back to one of the other streamers he met during that time, and that person's name was "SmallBronx". Eventually JoGames would become friends with this streamer, which would lead to him becoming a memeber of the SmallCrew.</p>
