            <p>JoGames235 was a channel thought up to be a "Gaming channel that was meant for people that just need something to relax to."  If you have ever seen his content you would know that this is somewhat true. JoGames235 makes a variety of content ranging from his “Gameplay to relax to” series, to his music which ended up moving over to his side channel “JoMusic235”.

            <p> SmallBronx is a streamer and the head of the SmallCrew Jo met during his time with another streamer called Blu, eventually Jo would become somewhat like a pal to Bronx and sometimes Jo gets to decide what he'll play during streams and sometimes even become a part of them as well.</p>
