In the beginning of his career, he started making content on Instagram. Though one day he decided to hop onto Tiktok, and that's when he would meet his first inspiration for content creation. A streamer that goes by the name Blu and eventually Jo would become one of his first moderators. 
After Blu retired, he went back to one of the other streamers he met during that time, and that person's name was "SmallBronx". Eventually JoGames would become friends with this streamer, which would lead to him becoming a memeber of the SmallCrew.
